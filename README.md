# Data-Analysis-Jobs-Salaries: SUMMARY- 
This project focuses on analyzing data scientist salaries using a dataset obtained from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries). Additionally, a "companies" table has been added to provide further details about the companies.
The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into the salary trends. Through SQL queries and data manipulation, I have adressed several relevant questions at basic-to-advanced level.

In this analysis, I have written SQL queries involving Joins, Aggregations,  Conditional statements and  Common table expressions 
to derive the following insights:
1. The analysis reveals that the overall average salary for data scientists across all job types is approximately 5L. This provides an understanding of the general salary range in the field.
2. The dataset includes information from 41 different countries, showcasing the global nature of data science job positions and salaries.
3. The analysis indicates that the role of Data Science Manager has the highest average salary, followed by the BI Data Analyst role. This highlights the potential higher earning opportunities in managerial positions within the data science field.
4.United States (US) has the highest number of Data Analysts, indicating a strong demand for data analysis skills in the country, but the average salary here is only half of the overall salary.
5. Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Machine Learning Engineers, and Data Analysts have the highest number of employees. This suggests that these job roles are popular and in-demand within the data science field. Also, the salaries of data scientists and data analysts is higher than the overall average salary.
6. Only 8.57% of employees have salaries greater than the overall average salary. This suggests a considerable salary gap between positions with high salaries and those with lower salaries.
7. The analysis shows that the "MI(mid-level)" experience level has the highest number of employees and the highest salary, indicating a strong demand for experienced professionals in the field.
8. The analysis indicates that large-sized companies offer the highest average salary, followed by small-sized companies, while medium-sized companies have the lowest average salary.
9. Company "ghi" is identified as offering the highest salary for the role of Data Scientist.
